# Introduction #
This page summarizes what Brian worked on each week.


# History #
## Week 8 ##
_February 19-25_

**Researched static QT builds and all in one deployments of projects for win32. (5 hours)**

**Built static QT with -qt-zlib and -qt-libpng which was tedious since mingw/gcc contains a bug that incorrectly looks for qlocale.cpp in the wrong set of includes (2 hours)**

**Gave up on static build for now and got a shared build to work, shared instructions on how to create such a beast (2 hours)**

**Looked into installers, leaning toward http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page**

**Familiarizing myself with new code**

**Built on both Windows 7 x64 and Ubuntu 11.10 x64**
