# TEST PLAN #

### Items to be Tested ###
  * Object testing
  * Connector testing
  * New diagram/project
  * Saving diagram/project
  * Loading diagram/project
  * Tab functionality:
    1. Diagrams retain integrity during a multiple tabs session
    1. Saving functions properly during a multiple tabs session
  * Legality (TBD)

### Test Implementation and Execution ###
The test cases will be performed via three different methods:
  1. Third party developed software.
  1. Test code written for specific cases.
  1. Manual "hands on" testing.

The test cases will be performed by at least two of the following:
  1. Test code written by developer.
  1. Another developer not familiar with that piece of the software will execute the test.
  1. A non-computer competent third party will manually test functionality.

### Test Case Log ###
The test case log will contain at a minimum:
  * Change set number
  * Date of test
  * Name of test code
  * pass/fail status
  * Extraneous observations
  * Risk level
  * Test code developer name
  * Test performer name

### Test Plan Backlog ###
  * A more comprehensive list of potential test cases is to be developed.
  * The major tests will begin on Week 9
  * More explicit testing requirements will need to be obtained before developing a more thorough test plan
