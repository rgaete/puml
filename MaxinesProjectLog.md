**Sunday, January 30, 2012**

Time: 6 hours
  * Worked on SSDD primarily.  Learned how to place images at appropriate places on page.
  * Completely revamped the component/entity design section and renamed it "feature design."  Instead of the 3 useless entity description sections, I created places for each of the interaction diagrams with feature design at the top of the page, and the diagram linked below. Filled in as best as I could, descriptions of each of the features and execution plan.
  * Added use cases to User's Architectural View section. Learned how to make a table and format it properly. Created tables for each of the use cases and filled in with workable data. This section should be able to be copied to the SSRS.
